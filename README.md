# VelocityMovement

This is a barebones version of the bunnyhopping movement used in my game, [Velocity](https://github.com/TheAsuro/Velocity).

## Installation

You will need [Unity3d Version 2017.1.0f3 or higher](https://unity3d.com/de/). Clone or download this repository, then open the downloaded directory as a project. The scene "example" located at Assets/Scenes/example.unity contains the working player character. The code relevant to bunnyhopping is located at Assets/Scripts/StrafeMovement.cs

## More Info

If you want to implement bunnyhopping yourself, I highly recommend [Bunnyhopping from the Programmer's Perspective](https://flafla2.github.io/2015/02/14/bunnyhop.html) and [More than you ever wanted to know about Air Strafing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=184184420).
